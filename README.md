Hi, I’m Rian.

I’m a designer, design technologist, and consultant based in Portland, Oregon.

I focus on solving UX/UI problems in order to help people access, understand, and take action on information.

I love collaborating with UX strategists, researchers, writers, designers, developers, and engineers. I help bridge the gap between design and engineering teams.

I work with type, color, layout, HTML, CSS, and presentational JS; iterating across sketches, prototypes, and code.
